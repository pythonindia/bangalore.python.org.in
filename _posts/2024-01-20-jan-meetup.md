BangPypers commenced its 2024 journey with the first meetup of the month on January 20, 2024, at Microsoft Reactor, Bangalore. The meetup was attended by 40 people who were a mix of new faces and returning members. We had a diverse lineup of three talks involving [MicroPython](https://micropython.org), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), and [Dunderhell](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/dunderhell) (writing Python code using only dunders).

We started with [Md Moinuddin](https://twitter.com/noobyco) presenting the talk [MicroPython - Python for Microcontrollers](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/20). Moinuddin provided an introduction and history of MicroPython, followed by a short demo on how to execute Python code on a microcontroller, and explained his project [Gamex](https://github.com/noobyco/gamex). Finally, he explained some differences (and similarities) between CPython and MicroPython to answer the question, "Will my Python code run on MicroPython?"

Our second talk was presented by [Pratik Pathak](https://twitter.com/zpratikpathak) on ["Time to Ditch requirements.txt and VENV, Start using Poetry now"](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/21). Pathak started by demonstrating an issue on why using a simple `requirements.txt` file for our Python projects is not enough. He then explained how using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) can simplify Python's packaging and dependency management.

We took a short 5-minute break and then gathered back for our final talk.

Finally, [Tushar Sadhwani](https://twitter.com/tusharisanerd) presented his talk ["How I made Dunderhell, the Ugliest Python Minifier"](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/22). Tushar explained how he wrote a tool called [Dunderhell](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/dunderhell), which converts Python code to only contain dunder (or magic) methods! Although seemingly fun(ny) project, Sadhwani used it to explain the "Visitor design pattern," which is what is being used in formatters like [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and other transpilers.

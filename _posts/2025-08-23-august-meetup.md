The August BangPypers meetup was hosted at McKesson Compile, where we had four talks: The Evolution of L5: Compile’s Spark-Based ETL Framework, Feedback in LLMs, DSPy – Stop Prompting, Start Programming LLMs, and Why t-strings are better than f-strings in Python. We also had an announcement about the upcoming MariaDB Hackathon.

[Malavika Menon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malavika-s-menon/) started the event with The Evolution of L5: Compile's Spark-Based ETL Framework, where she walked us through the design philosophy and performance improvements of L5, showing how the framework leverages Spark to streamline data pipelines more efficiently.

[Suhas Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhas-gupta-16984046/) followed with Feedback in LLMs, explaining why feedback mechanisms are essential for improving LLM performance, reliability, and user alignment, and how these feedback loops can be practically implemented.

[Ankur Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurgupta1982/) then presented DSPy – Stop Prompting, Start Programming LLMs, introducing DSPy as a structured approach to treating LLMs like programmable modules—moving away from ad-hoc prompt tweaks toward modular, maintainable pipelines.

[Tushar Sadhwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusharsadhwani/) delivered a lightning talk on Why t-strings are better than f-strings in Python, highlighting the new t-strings feature coming in Python 3.14 and how it improves string interpolation.

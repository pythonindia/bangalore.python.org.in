For October 2018's session, we had a session on ["Data Science"](https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/flmkdqyxnbbc/) . The venue was G0-JEK, Domlur and we had 3 speakers. All the sessions ran for around 40 minutes.

The first talk by Usha was on "Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models" . The talk started with the video by Judea Pearl following which
she gave an introduction to Graphical Models. Further into the talks she
discussed the traditional methods, and how Graphical Models came into light.
This talk consisted of the basics of probability - specifically Bayesian
Probability. Given the complexity of the subject, this will require a follow-up
talk, but the key takeaways of this talk were about the importance of a basic
understanding of probability to understand the topic better. The relevant
Python package is pgmpy.

The second talk was by Abdul - a talk on
Introduction to NLP basics, and using it with Spacy. He went over to demo Spacy
using a demo dataset from Kaggle which comprised of the Twitter activity around
JustDoit (Nike) hashtag. Kudos to Abdul, on giving a energetic talk.

After a small networking break, we started off with the next session, where
Divya talked about Language Models using Python. She started the talk from
scratch to discuss Language Models required in NLP as knowledge bases or
referential banks. For example, when a sentence is to be analyzed, it can be
parsed and understand based on the rules and guidelines set by the language
model.

We had 4 talks in the online meetup of July 2020. The theme decided as a virtue of talks selected was Testing and Code Quality.

- The first talk was by Hiral Amodia on Time Complexity using Python. In the process we revisited the different complexities code can take based on input size.
- The second talk was by Rohit Sanjay on Unit Testing Using Python. He spoke about the virtues of pytest and how it can be exploited to test our code better.
- The third talk was by Praveen Shirali on Pythonic Interfaces. He spoke about concepts like typehints, metaclasses, composition and also introduced an up-and-coming interface checker library - [implements](https://github.com/ksindi/implements).
- The fourth and final talk of the day was by Abhiram on Code Quality - the principles and the methods. He spoke about, what he considered where the 4 ways in which Code Quality could be segregated and went on to describe how each could be ensured.

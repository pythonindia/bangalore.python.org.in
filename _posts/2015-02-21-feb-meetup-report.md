The [Feburary Bangpypers meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/177630412/) happened at the IBM accelerator, EGL, Domlur. This time we had a total of 3 talks from 10:30AM to 12:45PM.

41 people attended the talks. The first talk [Emacs as Python IDE](https://chillaranand.github.io/emacs-py-ide/) by
[Anand](https://github.com/chillaranand/). The talk was walk through of different emacs packages which saves
lot of time while using Emacs. Obviously there were vim users :-). We didn't have any flame war!

Second talk was by [Vinayak](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/members/94675122/) about Data analysis using pandas.
We had hiccup for 15 minutes with laptop, then we resumed the talk. Vinayak gave good introduction about pandas. Lot of audience actively participated in discussion about high level vs low level framework for data analysis and machine learning.

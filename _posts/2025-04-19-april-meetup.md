The April BangPypers event, held at the vibrant UrbanPiper office, offered a captivating spectrum of knowledge for attendees. The talks covered everything from the KAG for LLMs to the flexible approach of polyglot programming, and provided a comprehensive overview of building and deploying applications with Flask.

[Jagan RS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagan-ps-130908186/) took the stage to share his expertise on leveraging KAG to significantly enhance the contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). His insights provided practical approaches to feeding LLMs with richer information, promising more accurate and relevant outputs in various applications..

[Tushar Sadhwani](https://x.com/tusharisanerd) concluded the event with an intriguing dive into polyglot programming. He showcased the power of writing scripts that could seamlessly run on both Python and Node.js, opening up interesting possibilities for developers. However, his talk also carried a crucial message, shedding light on how these very capabilities could be leveraged by malicious individuals, urging the audience to be mindful of potential risks.

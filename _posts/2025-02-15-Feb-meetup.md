BangPypers marked its 20th anniversary with a special meetup on February 15, 2025, at ThoughtWorks in Bangalore — the very place where it all began. The event featured two insightful talks centered around core Python topics, as well as a Community Panel that delved into the journey of organizing BangPypers over the years. It was a celebration of growth, learning, and the vibrant Python community!

[Tushar Sadhwani](https://twitter.com/tusharisanerd) kicked off his talk with a deep dive into ["Inside the Python Virtual Machine"](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/50), unraveling the inner workings of Python’s execution engine. He explored how Python code is compiled, how objects are represented, and the specific steps the interpreter takes to execute a Python program. This session provided a detailed understanding of the Bytecode VM, offering attendees valuable insights into the mechanics of Python's execution process.

Next, [Subhashree Banik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhashree-banik-a8537118a/) from ThoughtWorks took the stage with her presentation on [“Iterators, Generators, and the Power of Lazy Evaluation in Python”](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/51). She delved into how Python’s iterators and generators enable efficient, memory-friendly programming through lazy evaluation — a technique where values are computed only when required. Subhashree explained the key differences between iterators and generators, shedding light on how they work behind the scenes and why they are crucial for managing large datasets and optimizing performance. The talk also covered generator functions, generator expressions, and how infinite sequences can be handled with minimal memory overhead.

After the break, the event shifted to a community panel featuring [Anand Pillai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbpillai/), [Abhiram R](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhiramr5459/), and [Anirudh Kumar](https://x.com/kranirudha). The panel, focused on "The Journey of Organizing BangPypers", took the audience on a nostalgic journey through the memorable moments of past BangPypers events. The panelists shared insights, stories, and reflections on how the community has evolved over the years, giving attendees a heartfelt look back at the milestones and experiences that have shaped the BangPypers journey.

The meetup wrapped up with a fun quiz combining Bangalore and Python, a perfect way to celebrate what makes BangPypers so special — the vibrant community and the city’s deep connection to Python programming. It was a lighthearted and engaging end to an eventful day, bringing everyone together for a lot of laughs!

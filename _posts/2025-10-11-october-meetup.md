The October BangPypers meetup was hosted at [Amadeus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amadeus-india/), where we had three insightful talks: Learning End-to-End LLM Lifecycle Management with MLflow, Measuring and optimising the memory footprint of Python objects, and a session on ArgoCD and Argo Workflow.


[Ankur Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurgupta1982/) kicked off the event with *Learning End-to-End LLM Lifecycle Management with MLflow*. He detailed the challenges of modern "LLM Ops" and the need for programmatic methods like **DSPy**. Ankur demonstrated how MLflow provides a unified solution to manage this lifecycle, covering prompt versioning, pipeline tracing for crucial visibility, and automated quality checks using **"LLM as a judge"** evaluations.

[Anand B Pillai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbpillai/) followed with a deep dive into *Measuring and optimising the memory footprint of Python objects*. He explained the common pitfalls of using `sys.getsizeof()` and introduced more robust tools like `pympler` for an accurate analysis. The session was packed with practical optimization techniques, highlighting how `__slots__` reduces instance memory, the role of `weakrefs` in managing references, and the efficiency of `namedtuples`.

[Sneha Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneha-gupta-tech/) then presented on *Argo CD and Argo Workflows*. Her talk provided an overview of how these powerful tools work together. She explained that **Argo CD** facilitates GitOps and continuous delivery for cloud-native applications, enabling teams to manage infrastructure declaratively. She also covered how **Argo Workflows** serves as a container-native engine for orchestrating complex, parallel jobs directly within Kubernetes, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines and data processing.

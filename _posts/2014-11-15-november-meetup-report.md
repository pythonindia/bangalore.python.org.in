The [November BangPypers meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/160108012/) happened at the [Bang The Table][] office in Indira Nagar. [Sayan][] and [Arun][] facilitated the workshop. [Krace][] helped the meetup as a volunteer.

It's been around 6 months, since we conducted Python 101 session. We felt it is good time to conduct one. Without any surprise it was very well received.

55 people attended the session.

[Arun][] handled morning session about `variables, conditions, loops, strings, functions and list`.

We had a great heavy Indian lunch and [Sayan][] resumed the session around 1.45 PM.
[Sayan][] covered `inbuilt functions, dictionary, tuples, files, class, exception handling`.

We wrapped the session by 4.00 PM. Ramesh and his friend borrowed [Python 101 book](https://gumroad.com/l/bppWr) and [Two Scoops of Django 1.6](https://twoscoopspress.org/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6).

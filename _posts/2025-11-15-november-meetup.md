The November BangPypers meetup was generously hosted by [Cyware Labs India Pvt. Limited](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyware/), with food sponsored by the [MariaDB Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mariadb-foundation/). We featured two technical talks, the MariaDB Hackathon winners announcement + demos, and a personal experience sharing session from one of our community members about PyCon Finland.

[Jagan PS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagan-ps-130908186/) spoke on Ontologies with Agentic AI, explaining how formal ontologies — shared vocabularies, relationships, and rules — can give autonomous AI agents a semantic framework to reason more reliably, coordinate over multistage workflows, and make more structured decisions. This ontology-based reasoning helps agents interpret complex domains with clarity.

[Nikhil Lingadhal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-lingadhal-93b1b31a4/) presented Flexmetric – Instant Agent for Prometheus, introducing a lightweight, real-time agent mode in Prometheus. This mode disables querying and alerting, focuses on scraping and remote-write, and uses fewer resources — making it efficient for forwarding metrics to remote systems.

She also shared her PyCon Finland experience — key sessions, community take‑aways, and how she plans to apply her learnings to grow our local Python community.

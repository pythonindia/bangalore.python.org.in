The June Bangpyper meetup in collaboration with Google for Developers was hosted in Google Office, where we had talks from Google's Agent Development Kit, Firebase Studio by Google and we learned how big can a python integer become really (spoilers. large enough!) and how we can leverage opensource tool to profile python functions.

[Harish Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harishverma45/) Started the event with talking about Agent Development Kit by google explaining typical steps in building the agent how it has evolved.He gave a walkthrough on how Agent Development Kit can help in Building AI agents for one's usecase.

[Mayur Vaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayur-vaid-5422b8171/) showed us how we can start building and hosting our application through Firebase studio, and deploy our application.

Following this, [Tushar Sadhwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusharsadhwani/) had an interesting question! ***How large can a Python Integer really get?***, turns out "large enough"!, Tushar showed us how internally C struct for storing numbers manages storing of bits and optimizing arthmetic on these numbers.

Have you tried to profile your code and figure out fixes on your own!?, If you are using some third party app to profile your code, you must checkout [Nikhil Lingadhal's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-lingadhal-93b1b31a4/) open source tool that he has built to profile your codebase 
where an AI Agent would also provide you with proposed fixes, checkout more about it here [AIPyMemTimeProfiler](https://github.com/nikhillingadhal1999/AIPyMemTimeProfiler)

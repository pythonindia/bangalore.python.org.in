The [July BangPypers workshop][] happened at the [AdNear][] office in Koramangala. More than 80 people attended the workshop.

The workshop was focused on getting started with machine learning using `scikit-learn`. [Amol Agarwal][] started workshop with basics of numpy & matplotlib. He then explained what is machine learning, supervised and unsupervised learning.

After that, he explained several topics including classifiers, SVM, regression, clustering and validation. He showed machine learning use cases with examples like spam classification and facial recognition.

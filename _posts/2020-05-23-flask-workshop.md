**Date: 23 May 2020**

We at Bangpypers do workshops every now and then to break away from the monotony of talks (even if they aren't really monotonous). And this time we requested Vinay Keerthi - a programmer I've come to regard as extremely passionate about the art and the trade of programming. 

We started at 10.30 AM on the dot on a Zoom call. This was our second Online meetup (no thanks to Covid-19). The original plan was to wrap up by 1.30 PM but thanks to a rapt audience, the scope of the session and a super-energetic Vinay, we went on all the way up to 4.30 PM! ðŸ™‚

**What was discussed in the workshop?**

- Quick Introduction to Decorators
- Introduction to Flask
- Adding Routes
- Debugging Flask with VS Code
- Flask Modularization
- Adding a Database
- Creating a Front End
- Managing a Large Application

As vast as this scope seemed, Vinay made it extremely easy to follow and also provided a lot of interesting trivia along the way, along with some notes about his mechanical keyboards that some members really enjoyed , links to some interesting libraries that make the coder's journey a lot more fun and easier and also, his lovely pup Subbi ðŸ™‚.

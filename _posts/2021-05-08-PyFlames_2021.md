This month BangPypers collaborated with other python communities across India in organizing PyFlames 2021. This mega meetup was made possible by the efforts put in by the following communities:

- [HydPy](https://www.hydpy.org/)
- [PyDelhi](https://pydelhi.org/)
- [PyJaipur](https://www.pyjaipur.org/)

With [PyCon India 2021](https://in.pycon.org/2021/) fast approaching we are coming together to organise a series of mega meetups called PyFlames 2021(as a precursor event to the conference), the first of which happened on Saturday, May 8th. This event saw an attendance of around 75 people with a lineup of 8 talks touching different domains and was concluded by an open-house session with the PyCon India volunteers and organisers.

The lineup of talks looked like this:
- "How to get started with Programming?" by [Hari Sapna Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sapna2001/)
- "The File Server" by [Vipin Kumar](https://github.com/vipin3699/)
- "Building web apps for ML/AI using Python Streamlit" by [Suman Debnath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suman-d/)
- "Onwards and Upwards with Python" by [Subhashree Hazra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhashree-hazra/)
- "The Joy of Programming" by [Anand C](https://anandology.com/)
- "Ethical consideration while building AI Systems"- [Anjali Bhavan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjali-bhavan/)
- "Build Serverless Python applications using AWS Cloud" by [Harsh Bardhan Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshcasper/)
- "Python and Flutter application for Colouring and Enhancing old photos" by [Utkarsh Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/um07/)

To conclude that packed agenda we had an open-house discussion with the organisers of PyCon India answering questions from the audience, we saw discussions ranging from volunteering to pointers on presentation of talks at PyCon India. 

One of the highlights of the event was the rollout of the Early bird PyCon India tickets halfway through the event, which was a fine surprise to the audience. You can get your tickets [here](https://in.pycon.org/2021/#tickets)

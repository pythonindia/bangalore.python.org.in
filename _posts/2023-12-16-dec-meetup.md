We had our final meetup of 2023 at Gojek, Indiranagar Bangalore. About 25 people turned up to the [event](https://www.meetup.com/bangpypers/events/297574806).

Rahul Pydimukkala started out the first talk on ['Stream processing in Python'](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/18). An extensive introduction to reactive streams and how we can process asynchronous streams of data/events in Python using Reactive Extensions library.

Some more learning resources:
- [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)

We took a short tea and filter coffee break and returned to the second talk by [Sasidhar Donaparthi](https://twitter.com/sdonapar) on 'Vector Databases and Open Source Vector DB Milvus'.

Our third talk continued with [Kumar Abhijeet](https://twitter.com/kumar_abhijeet3) talking on ['How Patroni solved database reliability at Gojek'](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/19). This one needs another bigger session to go down in depths.

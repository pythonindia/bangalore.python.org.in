The January BangPypers meetup was a fantastic start to the new year, hosted at [Cloudsek](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudsek/?originalSubdomain=in), where we had three insightful sessions covering Recursive Language Models, Causal Reasoning Engines, and a deep dive into Python's GIL.

[Jayita Bhattacharyya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayita-bhattacharyya/) started the proceedings with her talk on *Recursive Language Models*. She explored how these models build upon themselves to achieve more complex reasoning and generation, showcasing their potential to tackle problems that are difficult for standard models.

[Soumya Ranjan Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumya-ranjan-das99/) presented the *Causal Reasoning Engine*. He introduced a framework for building systems that can understand cause and effect, moving beyond correlation to true causal inference. Soumya demonstrated how this is a critical step towards more robust and explainable AI.

[Viraj Sharma](https://sharmaviraj.com/) then took the stage to unravel the mysteries of the Global Interpreter Lock in his talk, *Unlocking Python’s GIL: Myth, Magic & Multicore*. He demystified the GIL, explained its impact on concurrent programming in Python, and explored modern techniques to work around it for true multicore parallelism.

We also had two engaging lightning talks:

[Abhishek Prasad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/compro-prasad/) delivered a lightning talk about [*Datastar*](https://data-star.dev/), a lightweight frontend framework with native support for Server-Sent Events (SSE).

[Archit Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/i-archit-gupta/) presented a lightning talk on *Cyber Security Basics*, providing essential insights and practical tips for securing digital assets and understanding common threats.

The first talk was by Ram about setting up Jenkins Pipeline. Trust me Jenkins is a beast Open Source CI/CD/More software. Here is the link to the talk [demo](https://github.com/mramanathan/jenkins_pipeline_demo).

The second talk was by Bibhas, quick introduction to AWS Lambda using Python. AWS Lambda is one of the leading providers of serverless architecture. I feel the name is a misnomer!

Anand B gave climax talk of the meetup. He spoke about Concurrency in Python 3.0. If you have spent a little bit time in Python, you must have heard about infamous GIL! He talked about multi-threading, multi-processing, asyncio and when to use each one of them. The content is private, and you can leave a comment in the meetup against Anand's comment to receive the snippets in your inbox.

See you at the next meetup!

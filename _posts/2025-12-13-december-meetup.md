The December BangPypers meetup was hosted at [Flexera](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flexera/), where we had five engaging sessions: AI-Driven DevOps, AI Browsers, a deep dive into favorite PEPs, Responsible Agentic AI Frameworks, and an introduction to GPU Programming in Python.


[Megha Kadur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megha-kadur/) kicked off the event with *AI-Driven DevOps: Smarter and Faster CI/CD Workflows*. She detailed how artificial intelligence is transforming traditional DevOps practices, moving beyond simple automation to predictive analysis. Megha demonstrated how integrating AI into CI/CD pipelines can optimize build times, predict failure points before deployment, and streamline workflows for smarter, faster delivery.

[Amrutha Y](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amrutha-y/) followed with a fascinating session on *AI Browsers: Redefining the Web Experience with Intelligent Agents*. She explored the shift from traditional browsing to agent-based interactions, where AI doesn't just search for information but actively performs tasks. The talk covered the architecture of these intelligent agents and how they are redefining user interactions with the web.

[Tushar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusharsadhwani/) then took the stage to share *My Favourite PEPs*. In a session that resonated with Python enthusiasts, he walked us through the Python Enhancement Proposals that have significantly shaped the language. From foundational style guides to complex syntactic sugars, Tushar explained the "why" and "how" behind these PEPs, offering a deeper appreciation for Python's design philosophy.

[Jagan PS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagan-ps-130908186/) presented on *Responsible Agentic AI Frameworks*. As AI agents become more autonomous, ensuring safety and ethics is paramount. Jagan provided a comprehensive framework for building responsible agents, discussing guardrails, transparency, and the necessary checks to ensure agentic behaviors remain aligned with human intent.

[Abhik Sarkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhiksark/) closed the day with *GPU Programming 101 in Python*. Aimed at demystifying parallel computing, Abhik introduced the audience to the power of GPUs for accelerating Python applications. He covered the basics of CUDA and libraries like Numba and PyTorch, showing how developers can unlock massive performance gains for data-intensive tasks.

Various ways to compute the solution for the problem was discussed. Each approach was discussed with its pros and cons. Every approach was solved in white board first and later in Python. Lot of classic computer science concepts like [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), [Greedy Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) were discussed. During the course of the workshop various problems and solutions were discussed.

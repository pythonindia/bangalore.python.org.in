The [June Bangpypers talk](https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/184903022/) happened at the Apigee, Koramangala. After 6 months we had talks! Talks started at 3.00 PM and ended at 5.00 PM.

25 people attended the talks. There  were two talks. First talk was [writing better python code](https://gist.github.com/kracekumar/09a60ec75a4de19b346e) by [Kracekumar][]. The talk took few badly written python code and showed how to make the code better. Talk went for 40 minutes. Second talk was [What is magic methods](https://gist.github.com/vigneshsarma/bf5f664d8d053890e5f7) by [Vignesh sarma](https://gist.github.com/vigneshsarma).

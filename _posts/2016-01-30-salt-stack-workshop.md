We kickstarted this year's meetup with  [salt stack workshop](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/222071834/) at [mavenhive technologies](http://www.mavenhive.in/). There were 23 participants.


[Ram](https://gitlab.com/voidspacexyz/) took the session. He started with what is devops, why we need dev ops and various  tools available for devops.


Then he explained about salt stack, master, minion, grains, pillars, modules e.t.c and how to automate configuration management on multiple servers.


There was a break for about 10 minutes.


After resuming from break, participants then tried to deploy a web app (Junction) to a virtual machine using saltstack. There were questions about grains, pillars from participants and Ram explained clarified about them.


Here are few pictures from the meetup.

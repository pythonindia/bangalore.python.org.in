We kicked off the second half of 2025 with an exciting July Python Meetup, held in collaboration with Django India and hosted by the folks at MeshDefend.ai. The lineup of talks brought together an engaging mix of cutting-edge topics and hands-on insights.

[Ravi Chitloor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-chitloor/) opened the session with an insightful talk on Generative AI in the Enterprise. He walked us through how GenAI is rapidly transforming various domains — from customer support to content generation — and its growing role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). His talk shed light on how enterprises are integrating GenAI into their development workflows, improving productivity, and enhancing innovation across teams.

Following him, [Manjunath Janardhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manjunath-janardhan-54a5537/) gave a hands-on talk on using PyCaret for AutoML. He walked us through how PyCaret simplifies the process of feature selection and model comparison, significantly speeding up traditional ML workflows. He also touched upon PyCaret's applicability in MLOps pipelines, showcasing how it can integrate seamlessly into production environments for continuous training and deployment.

[Abhishek Prasad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/compro-prasad/) followed with a crisp and focused talk on asynchronous programming in Python. He broke down when and why to use async, helping the audience understand where asyncio shines — especially in I/O-bound operations like API calls, network requests, or concurrent task management. His session was packed with real-world examples and best practices for writing non-blocking, efficient Python code.

Finally, [Jagan PS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagan-ps-130908186/) wrapped up with a deep dive into Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the context of Agentic AI. He highlighted how rapidly the AI landscape is evolving — moving from simple models to autonomous, multi-step agents capable of reasoning and planning. Jagan explained the role of MCP as a structured approach to building such agents by breaking tasks into modular, context-aware components. His session included practical insights into how developers can start building their own agentic workflows using MCP, making a complex topic feel approachable and relevant.

This meetup was different from previous one. Every meetup is different and unique since topics and attendees are different. This meetup was a testbed for a new format called `Short Talks`. Each short talk lasts for ten minutes and Q&A for five minutes. In fifteen minutes, a talk is over. We had seven such talks in Feb meetup.

[Sahaj Software Solutions](https://www.sahajsoft.com/) hosted [feb meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/236371821/). Nearly 50 folks attended the meetup. The event commenced at 10:30 AM and went on til 1:00 PM.

The [May BangPypers workshop](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/222588421/) happened at the [RedHat][] office in Bannerghatta Road.

The workshop was focussed on writing unit test and functional tests in Python using `unittest, py.test, mock`. The presenter [Kracekumar]() started
the workshop by briefing basic command line program to create phonebook app. The application was designed to take the input from the command line
and store in Sqlite3.
